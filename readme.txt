Extends Event Tickets Plus' custom attendee field functionality, by allowing site admins to edit submitted attendee data.

== Description ==

[Event Tickets Plus](https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-event-tickets-plus/) allows event organizers to [collect arbitrary data](https://theeventscalendar.com/knowledgebase/collecting-attendee-information/) from attendees. However, once submitted it is not possible or easy to edit it.

This extension adds the ability for admins to edit submitted additional field information via the attendee screen.

== Installation ==

Install and activate like any other plugin!

* You can upload the plugin zip file via the *Plugins â€£ Add New* screen
* You can unzip the plugin and then upload to your plugin directory (typically _wp-content/plugins)_ via FTP
* Once it has been installed or uploaded, simply visit the main plugin list and activate it
